        Lapyear is the story of David, a college student who realizes his fiance isn't right for him, and his
        journey of rediscovery of himself. When his relationship falls apart his mother asks about two women
        from his past and if they would be better suitors. They appear wearing wedding dresses, though only David sees them.
        David sees these girls hovering around all the women he later encounters, in a surrealist representation of his
        inability to see women as anything other than potential partners. He spends time with his more 'free of soul'
        younger brother, and through that he eventually learns to overcome this issue, and finally have a pressure free
        conversation with a woman his age.

        Lapyear was the first piece or writing longer than a short story I had ever completed.
        I had this idea in high school, ironically during a stable relationship. Years later when my first college writing
        class asked for a piece of fiction, I finally started to write it. I had
        never written a screenplay before, but the story demanded it, so I dove in.
        My professor loved it, and with her help, far beyond the scope of the class,
        and extending into following semesters and breaks, she helped me refine and eventually finish it.

        Looking back, it definitely feels a bit on the nose with the themes, and is short - coming in at 28 pages.
        I am proud of it, being my first piece of writing that I ever felt was complete. It was also my first foray
        into writing humor, and that went over well with readers and tonally those scenes blended into the surrealism.
