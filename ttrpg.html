        As a longtime Tabletop RPG gamer, I've started to
        understand exactly what I'm looking for in my games mechanics-wise. Why did D&D 5e feel so
        shallow? What about D&D 3.5 (the system I grew up reading cover to cover even when I had nobody
        to play with) was difficult for new players, yet captured my childhood imagination so?</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2;">
          I decided to design my own system that incorporated
          the character building freedom of 3.5 and Pathfinder 2e with the simplicity of combat layout of
          Index Card RPG by Runehammer, with mechanics from the Fantasy Flight Star Wars RPG thrown in to balance things out.</p>

          <h3>Zones</h3>
          <p id="Pl">
          The Core Mechanic that separates the game from traditional D&D is how it handles combat. The
          grid system is a carry over from D&D's wargaming roots, and it was one of the parts of the game
          that really slows down play, especially with new players.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="halfLdiv">
        <div id="halfLdivC">
          <p id="Pl">
            A zone would represent a space where everyone occupying a zone is within melee range of each other.
            A player on their turn would have 3 actions; two can be for anything, one can be for anything that isn't
            combat. Moving from one zone to another with no difficult terrain complications would take one action.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div id="halfLdivC">
          <p id="Pl">
            For example: "You approach a castle and find a pair of guards standing in front of a bridge spanning the castle moat.
            There is also a pair of guards on the castle battlements with bows."</p>
            <p id="Pl">
              The zones are, the grass before the bridge, the bridge, the grass at the castle gate after the bridge, and the battlements.
              To move to the battlements, the GM would call for a climb check that may take two actions rather than one, or even
              all three for a player's whole turn, but it simplifies combat immensely. Four zones you can occupy, maybe only two
              can go abreast on the bridge, and a climb check to move to the battlements, and the GM has set the scene. No
              grid or counting squares necessary.</p>

          <h3>Character Building</h3>
          <p id="Pr">
          The biggest difference I found between 3.5e and 5e is how characters are built.
          3.5 allowed for so much more freedom and building as you go, while 5e more sets
          the player on a path from the start.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
        <div id="halfRdiv">
          <div id="halfRdivC">
            <p id="Pr">
            Pathfinder 2e did character building wonderfully. Each class gets a choice of class
            feats every other level, as well as additional choice within race selection. My game
            adopts this style, giving a catalogue of feats for each class to build as they go.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="halfRdiv">
          <div id="halfRdivC">
            <p id="Pr">
            Allowing a player to select class feats every other level also lead to nerfing the power
            of each feat in question, which ends up helping the problem of feeling pressured into sticking
            exactly to one particular mechanic to maximize character power. With a diversity of weaker
            individual feats, experimentation and choosing for flavor is encouraged.</p>

        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2;">
          In my opinion, just as important as the game mechanics themselves are how the
           rules are taught. I started to learn Figma in an attempt to make the pages teaching
            the rules as well laid out and digestible as possible.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2;">
            I thought of the games and pages I liked in the tabletop rpg space, and which I didn't, and realized
            that I needed to keep walls of text small, and any elements that could be represented in a list or
            chart should be.</p>
