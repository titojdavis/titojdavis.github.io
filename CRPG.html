                  I spent one of my summers off having trouble getting any prose out, so I worked on a project I'd had in the back of my mind since I was 10 years old playing Neverwinter Nights 2.
                  It's not one I ever expect to become a reality, but it had been rattling around in my head for so long it felt good to finally indulge it. I wrote the narrative for a CRPG. I tried
                  to take all of what I loved about my favorite games and use it for my own. I worked on it in bits all summer and into the school year. I wanted a story that was deeply personal
                  and would takle an idea and explore it from many different angles. I went with "Community".
              </p>
              <p id="cent">
                  The entirety of the 30,000 word narrative doc, and the 7,500 word companion doc aren't
                  included here. I'm presenting two characters, and two scenarios the player would get into. I made sure to keep each to a single page, which took out quite a few of the more complex bits of the
                  narrative, especially social situations that had to track many NPCs what what they know.

                  <p id="Pl">
                      All of my favoire companions in CRPGs both weaved themselves into the story somehow, and showed some personal growth if I encouraged it.
                      Characters like Khelgar Ironfist who surprised the player with depth while twisting a trope, Safiya who felt completely intertwined with
                      the world and plot, and Wenduag redeeming herself. Each of my characters has a flaw that they have the potential to grow from during their
                      journey.

                      Aymide was one of the first companions I came up with, and was initially inspired by my relationship with academia. She's grown well beyond
                      that as the story grew, but that inial seed is still present. I considered going right into teaching in higher ed following college, but was
                      encouraged to go out and do other things first. That same summer I also went to a couple funerals of different cultures, and that too was on my mind.

                      I knew I wanted to implement Nel, an NPC I had written for a D&D campaign for my brothers, into my story, and Aymide made that easy with where I
                      wanted to take her arc. She has a small plot driver that connect to her sorcerer bloodline powers, and that helps connect her to the lore of the world
                      outside of just her culture and the mechanics of play.

                  <p id="Pr">
                      Uji II was one of the later additions to my story, but ended up feeling like one of the most connected with the world's cosmology. I spent a lot of
                      time working on hwo the world would work to help reflect and push my theme, as well as differentiate it from Golarion, The Forgotten Realms, or any
                      other fantasy world people were used to playing in. Maybe at some point I'll add a section here to show off some of the world.

                      Having a character that you meet early on that can help you understand the world, especially for an unestablished one, can be important. Uji not only
                      connects to the cosmology with her relation to Spirits, but also to the history of the world by being the descendent of one of the old Dynastic Emperors.
                      Her arc relates to how I feel about my extended family, and how I feel looking at old pictures of family I never got the chance to meet.

                      I get a lot of inspiration from art in all forms, but for a lot of my characters, I come up with an idea and flesh it out halfway before searching for
                      art inspiration for how to expand on those ideas. Much of Uji's story was inspired by the brilliant piece included here by Kii Weatherton.

                      I've written the scenarios I'm including here to not include any descriptive text like one might see in an adventure path because my prose is displayed
                      elsewhere and I wanted to keep these to a page. I love how open to interpretation situations are in games like Divinity Original Sin 2 and the Pathfinder
                      games and want to have elements of that in my own story. An obstacle is presented, but how to deal with it is up to you.

                  <p id="Pl">
                      This situation comes up early in the story, and is a low stakes road encounter that will help you get to know your companions better as well as figure out
                      what how you want to roleplay your own character. Do you feel for these lower beings that you find in your path, or will you stomp on them for getting in the 
                      way?

                      The companions mentioned here are not the ones shown above. Here, they are reduced to their reactions to events and it only hints at their personality. 
                      As those lines add up, a clearer picture of who a character is will be painted. Everything doesn't have to be in monologues or long conversations. In the 
                      spirit of keeping these to a single page, the first scenario will show more how I approach giving options to solving problems.

                      The second scenario leans into the lore of the world, the deeper parts of your companions' struggles and internality, and is more atmospheric. Some
                      character arcs are difficult to pepper moments for into the story, but I've found that no companion feels like a part of the story enough to bring them
                      around with me until they're interacting with the world in places that aren't specifically built for them. I especially try to do that for Imharr here.

                  <p id="Pr">
                      Imharr's arc was easy to integrate into the plot because the player will end up in both his home city he is banished from, as well as with the Holeans; 
                      two major pieces of who he is and why he changes. But when a character feels so easy, it usually means I'm leaving out some intricacy that I could explore.
                      I show his relationship with the leadership of his clan, the descendents of the Holeans he served with, but not any of the humans involved.

                      There are bits of mystery in the story but it's so hard to know how to drip feed information so that it's satisfying throughout. I didn't include exactly how
                      the ending scene in the academy lab gives some answers about the central mystery while opening up further mystery, because it wouldn't make sense out of context, but that
                      is another major element of this scenario. You'll learn a bit about how they're made, but complicate the question of who is making them and why.

              <p id="cent">
                  It's impossible to include everything you love about a genre in a single story. I would love to meet the person who could show me how to include influence from Hylics 2 in any
                  story, but I decided from early on my more major influences would be Neverwinter Nights 2 and the Pathfinder games. The broadstrokes of the plot, the worldbuilding, maybe aren't
                  shown off here, but this is how I could figure out how to show off a taste of it.
