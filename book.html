        Amir Davidson has invented faster than light travel, and so he and his co-pilot Melik are
        going to fly to the next star system over and take some pictures and bring them back to Earth.
        The story begins on launch day. Shortly after transitioning to hyperspace, something goes wrong
        and Amir and Melik are knocked out.</p>
        <p id="LtC" style="padding-bottom: .25rem; padding-top: .25rem;">When he awakes in a bed he doesn't recognize, he is quickly whisked off to a stage.
        It's a welcome for the Earth, the most recent planet to finally achieve interstellar travel; the
        galaxy has been waiting. One thing however, Amir's ship doesn't travel like everyone else's. While
        everyone else has to use "Slings", a sort of star gate, his ship can transition to hyperspace itself.
        Rather than let this information out, he plans to utilize his unique and untraceable ship.</p>
        <p id="LtC" style="padding-top: .25rem;">Meanwhile, the Earth struggles to throw off greedy corporations that have landed
        and started to extract resources. Amir's brothers and parents lead their local section of the
        resistence effort.</p>

        Everything from the plot, to the characters, to the worldbuilding elements have gone through dozens
        of iterations. Sometimes a detail will feel right in the moment, but when I return to it it feels
        too on the nose or too off in left field. There was a time when I tried to map each of the four main
        characters to the four archetypes given in "King, Warrior, Magician, Lover" by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette.
        I've since gone away from it, but it definitely helped shape the characters even if I'm no longer holding
        them to those archetypes anymore.

        To structure the book I mostly use Dan Harmon's Story Circle for everything from overarching plot,
        to character arcs, to single scenes. I've found it's simple and hits all the beats I'm looking for.
        My notebook is full of story circles, doodles, lists, poems, quotes, and everything in between.
        For this project, I've tended to over-build, then strip away everything that doesn't fit. That
        includes over-building metephors and symbols, then stripping elements away to avoid approaching allegory.
        Unlike previous projects, I've liked this stripping away more than any other part of writing this book.
        Going back through with fresh eyes and a better knowledge of what tone I want and being able to
        prune everything away that doesn't contribute to that has been very satisfying.
