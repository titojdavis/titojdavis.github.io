		<p id="Pl">I work at Discovery Charter School in <strong>Student Enrichment</strong>. That means I pull students from class 
		to work with them individually on special projects in areas of study they are proficient in. I work with students K-6th grade.
		</p>
		<p id="Pl">I also love to write fiction in my free time. I primarily write <strong><span style="color: #825C98">Science Fiction</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #825C98">Fantasy</span></strong>. I 
		have two completed short stories, and a completed screenplay. I try to make my stories strongly based in themes and emotions rather than plot. Lately I have been working on 
		a sci-fi novel that I have been working on, in pieces, for the greater part of three years.
		</p>
		<p id="Pl">I enjoy being outdoors, playing and watching sports, and of
            course, a good book. I like to travel, but only if I can stay a while. I've spent
            two months in Portugal and a year in Israel. I appreciate art in all forms from my
            tattoos to the art I hang in my room. Above all I love my family and friends, without whom I am nothing.

        <p id="Pl">I'm a storyteller looking for work in games. I primarily work in sci-fi
          or fantasy, and am a practiced worldbuilder. To find my <strong>worldbuilding</strong> projects,
          check out my <span style="color: #825C98"><strong><a href="conf" style="color: #825C98;">Conference Experience</a></strong></span> tab, or 
          <span style="color: #825C98"><strong><a href="legendkeeper" style="color: #825C98;">Legendkeeper</a></strong></span>
          under Work.
        </p>
        <p id="Pl">To find work in a <strong>screenplay</strong> format check out the <span style="color: #825C98"><strong><a href="lapyear" style="color: #825C98;">
          Lapyear</a></strong></span> tab. It was the first
          piece longer than a short story I ever finished. I also am working on a tabletop RPG system,
          and that can be found in the <span style="color: #825C98"><strong><a href="ttrpg" style="color: #825C98;">TTRPG</a></strong></span> tab.
          <p id="Pl">And finally, to see what I've been working on lately and see how I <strong>structure</strong> my stories 
            check out my book. It's a <span style="color: #825C98"><a href="book" style="color: #825C98;"><strong>sci-fi novel</a></strong></span>. 
            This is a project that I am both proud of the work I have done, and am excited to finish.
