        In 2017 I went on a study abroad to Portugal with Dr. Trent Hergenrader, often referred to as The Worldbuilding
        Professor by the folks at World Anvil. The class was
        to collaboratively build an alternate reality version of Porto. The study abroad was so
        that Dr. Hergenrader could present his class at the Electronic Literature Organization
        global conference. I assisted him both in his presentation of his then forthcoming book,
        and hosting a worldbuilding workshop using cards of his design.</p>

          <h3>The Project</h3>
          <p id="Pl">
          With a group of eight, we started by reading genre short stories, then choosing a genre for
          our world. After choosing the genre, using the cards, we randomly selected the major
          focuses of our world. The cards have a series of 14 topics in four categories:
          Economic, Governance, Social Relations, and Cultural Relations. For each of the 14 subcategories,
          a number card is drawn ranging from 1 to 5, then an additional card that says whether that subcategory
          is trending or not. A 1 represents that category not being very prevalent or strong, and a 5 would mean
          that category is present in citizens everyday lives.</p>

      </div>
      <div id="halfLdiv">
        <div id="halfLdivC">
          <p id="Pl">After the drawing, a long discussion about what each one means, and based on what points of reference.
            For example, is a 2 in Race Relations on the precipice of a race war? What would you grade them on campus? In
            our home city? And how does a 2 in one spot work with a 5 in another that is seemingly related? It was a long,
             but enlightening discussion. Once this was hashed out, we could move on to
            how that applied to the world we were building, and what it looked like for our genre. The basic structures
            of the world were agreed on. Topics were asssigned to pairs, and those pairs went and wrote up wiki
            articles for each going into detail about how that aspect of life worked in our alt-Porto.

          <p id="Pl">
            Finally, we each made a handful of characters, locations, and items, to occupy our world. These were shuffled
            and distributed at random. We took our classmates creations and had to make a couple vignettes and a short
          story. It was fascinating seeing how people viewed your characters and locations based only on the couple
          paragraphs you gave them.</p>

          <h3>The Conference</h3>
          <p id="Pr">
          Dr. Hergenrader had me accompany him to the conference and we presented the project as a way to explore
          collaborative creation. Depending on what was emphasised, there were many pedagological applications.

            I was there to tell about my experience with the project, and what I think could have changed. My
            only real change was that unless the emphasis was on the sociological discussion around the
            numbers and categories, I would recommend group size of 3-6 rather than 8. Our world ended up
            slightly inconguous in places due to 'too many cooks' syndrome.</p>

            Afterward, we hosted a workshop where we actually ran conference participants through the card drawing
            and discussion process in an attempt to, in 45 minutes, create a rough idea of a world that fits the cards.
            My group came up with a post-post apocalypse setting, that being the first society to rise after disaster.
            This setting tends to be popular in this project because it gives an easy answer to 'how would society get to
            this point?' that must be asked. The easy answer being, it all tore down and was rebuilt.</p>

        <h3>Project Conclusions</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2;">I found that some of my best creative work comes
        when I work in a group. Bouncing ideas from one person to another when worldbuilding creates
        a creative force that is greater than the sum of its parts. Despite the end product not being
        the cleanest, the paired work was excellent, and I believe with a touch more authoritative words
        to keep the coherence, it would have worked beautifully. Without Dr. Hergenrader influencing the
        creative discussions, the correct choice for a class, and no hierarchy amongst the students, some
        ideas had a hard time being let go, and were jammed in where they didn't fit.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2;">
          A highlight of the workshop for me was getting the numbers to click with a Dr. of Sociology who at
          first couldn't understand how a 2 in economic wealth could exist with a 4 in economic distribution.
          Getting the 'yes it doesn't seem to work at first, how could you see that happening?' out of him was
          exactly the lightbult moment I was after.</p>
